# Takehome Control Script
#
# To use this script run it as root - it will switch to the specified user
#
# Here is a little (and extremely primitive) startup/shutdown script
# for RedHat based systems. It assumes that Takehome lives in /usr/local/takehome,
# it's run by user 'takehome' and JDK binaries are in /usr/java/default/bin.
# All this can be changed in the script itself.
#
# Either modify this script for your requirements or just ensure that
# the following variables are set correctly before calling the script.
